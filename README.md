# ASSIGNMENT #1: 30MFF WEBSITE

## Description:
This project is a website that showcases the the film we created for the 30 Minutes Film Festival called **Our Experience at Expo 2020** which was created in collaboration with my classmate Keji. The concept of the website was to provide the user with information about the film by making the website easy to understand and usable. In order to make it easy to use I went with a simple layout design where everything is clear on the webpage.

## Process:

## Reflection:

///Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.
Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.
Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.///
