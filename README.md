## Title:
Our Experience at EXPO 2020

## Description:
This project is a website that showcases the the film we created for the 30 Minutes Film Festival called **Our Experience at Expo 2020** which was created in collaboration with my classmate Keji. The concept of the website was to provide the user with useful information about the film specifically about its content, Expo 2020. I achieved this by adding info about some of the pavilions in one of my pages and making the website easy to understand and usable. In order to make it easy to use I went with a simple layout design where everything is clear on the webpage.

## Process:
1. Sketching a simple wireframe.
2. Creating a digital wireframe. (More notes on the wireframe [here](https://github.com/SalamaAlmheiri/CommLab/tree/main/Wireframe))
3. Writing a simple layout on html.

## Reflection:
- While working on the CSS, I reliezed that I planned for more pages than I needed so I combined some of the pages to fit on 2 pages for my website.
- I also planned to make the website more interactive, however I also realized that my expectations were higher than the reality and my little knowledge on Javascript programming.
- But overall, I learned A LOT of new things from making this website and I am simply happy that the website functions how I want it.
